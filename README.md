# Battle Pass Tracker for Android
This is the android version of the Battle Pass Tracker Web Application that can be found [here](https://github.com/Jimmy-Du/battle-pass-tracker).
The goal of this android application is to provide users a quick and easy way to view battle pass info 
for the games that they play. Users can also opt-in for notifications displayed directly on their phone
when certain periods of time has passed during the battle pass season to remind them of when the season 
is ending.
